                    Bridge developed from older trick-taking games, such as the popular 18th- and 19th-century game of whist.
                    One such development was the rise of Biritch, also referred to as Russian Whist, which included early bidding notions
                    that would become a mainstay in later iterations of the game. Early forms of whist served as a foundation for deeper card games.

                    <br><br>

                    Early in the 20th century, Auction Bridge developed as a result of players' experiments with different bidding techniques. 
                    It added a strategic auction phase to decide the contract for every hand. The game was gradually changed by scoring innovations
                    and rule changes throughout this time, which opened the door for additional improvement. In the 1920s, important players
                    like Harold Vanderbilt helped create Contract Bridge, which established the scoring system and norms that are now the norm in contemporary play.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Today, Contract Bridge is praised all over the world as a game that blends strategy, talent, and good partner communication. 
                    It is an active component of the international card-playing community and is played competitively in clubs, tournaments, 
                    and recreational settings.

                        Bridge is a classic trick-taking card game played with four players in two partnerships. 
                        The game is divided into two main phases: bidding and play. 
                        During the bidding phase, players take turns predicting how many tricks their team can win, 
                        based on their cards. The highest bid determines the "contract" and which team will try to meet it. 
                        In the play phase, players play one card each round (a trick), 
                        and the highest card in the leading suit—or a trump suit if declared—wins the trick. Strategy, 
                        communication, and memory are key, as players must work with their partner to outsmart their opponents 
                        and fulfill their contract.

                                meaning even the lowest-ranked trump card can beat the highest card of any non-trump suit.
