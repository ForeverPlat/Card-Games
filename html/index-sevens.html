                    The card game "Sevens," also known as "Laying Out Sevens," "Fan Tan," or "Parliament," has a rich history with roots in various cultures. Its exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but the game's fundamental mechanics have been present in numerous regional variations 
                    over the centuries. The primary objective across these versions involves players shedding their cards by sequentially playing them in a specific order, typically starting with the seven of each suit. This gameplay resembles that of dominoes,
                     where players lay down cards in a connected sequence, reflecting the game's adaptability and widespread appeal.

                    <br>
                    In different countries, "Sevens" has adopted unique names and rules, showcasing its versatility. In the United States, the game is often referred to as "Fan Tan" or "Play or Pay," where players aim to be the first to discard all their cards by building upon the sevens 
                    laid out on the table. In France, a similar game called "Domino" allows players to start sequences with any rank, adding a layer of strategic variation. These regional adaptations highlight the game's ability to transcend cultural boundaries while maintaining its core mechanics.

                    The enduring popularity of "Sevens" can be attributed to its simple yet strategic gameplay, making it accessible to players of all ages. Its presence in various cultures under different names underscores its universal appeal and adaptability. Whether played in a casual family setting or as a competitive pastime, "Sevens" continues to be a beloved card game that brings people together through its engaging and timeless mechanics.

                Sevens is a simple yet engaging card game that can be played with a standard 52-card deck and three to eight players. The game begins with all cards being dealt evenly among the players. The player who has the 7 of Diamonds (or another predetermined suit) starts the game by placing it
                 in the center of the table. From there, players take turns placing cards in sequence, either adding to the existing rows by playing the next higher or lower card in a suit or by placing another seven to start a new row. If a player is unable to make a legal move, they must pass their turn. 
                 The objective is to be the first to play all of one's cards while strategically blocking opponents from making moves.
            </p>
            <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                As the game progresses, strategic decisions become crucial. Players must decide whether to play their cards immediately or hold onto them to control the flow of the game. Since only adjacent ranks (one above or one below) can be played on an existing row, holding onto key cards—such as eights or sixes—can
                 temporarily prevent other players from continuing a sequence. This element of blocking adds a tactical layer to an otherwise straightforward game. Players must also be mindful of their opponents’ remaining cards, as a well-timed play can force them into a position where they are unable to make a move.
            </p>
            <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                The game ends when one player successfully plays all of their cards, or when no further moves can be made. If multiple players are stuck and cannot make a move, the winner is determined based on who has the fewest remaining cards. Some variations include penalties for players who are unable to play, 
                adding an extra layer of competitiveness. Because of its easy-to-learn rules and emphasis on strategy, Sevens is a great game for both casual and competitive play, making it a popular choice for family gatherings and card game enthusiasts alike.

                            <span class="strategy-meaning"></span> This strategy involves keeping important cards in your hand, such as sixes and eights, rather than playing 
                            them immediately. By doing so, you can control the flow of the game and prevent your opponents from playing certain cards. 
                            Since players must play cards in sequential order, withholding these key cards can effectively block your opponents from progressing.If an opponent needs a 6 of Hearts to
                             continue a sequence, you can hold onto it, forcing them to pass their turn. However, if you wait too long, you may find yourself unable to play your remaining cards before the game ends.

                <p class="term-text">
                    "Blocking" is a defensive strategy where a player deliberately withholds certain cards, particularly those that would allow opponents to continue building sequences. 
                    By holding onto these critical cards, such as a 6 or an 8 needed to connect to a played 7, a player can prevent others from playing their cards, 
                    forcing them to pass. Effective blocking can control the game's pace and provide a strategic advantage, but it requires careful consideration to avoid self-impediment.

                    Sevens (7s)
                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    The term "Sevens" refers to the four cards of rank seven in each suit. These cards are pivotal in the game, as each seven serves as the starting point for building sequences 
                    in its respective suit. The game typically begins with a player placing a seven (often the 7 of Diamonds) in the center, and subsequent cards are added in ascending or descending
                     order to this foundation. The strategic placement of sevens dictates the flow of the game and opens opportunities for players to play their other cards.

                <p class="term-text">
                    "Building" refers to the process of adding cards to the sequences that originate from each seven. Once a seven is played, players can build upon it by placing the next higher or lower 
                    card of the same suit. For example, after the 7 of Diamonds is on the table, the 6 of Diamonds can be placed to its left, and the 8 of Diamonds to its right. This building 
                    continues until the sequences in all suits are completed from Ace through King. Strategic building allows players to manage their hands effectively and can be used to block opponents'
                     moves.

                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    "Passing" occurs when a player cannot legally play any card from their hand during their turn. In such cases, the player must pass, forfeiting their turn to the next player. Passing can be a result of strategic play by opponents who have blocked available moves, or simply due to the player's current hand composition. While passing is sometimes
                     unavoidable, frequent passes can hinder a player's progress and increase the likelihood of retaining high-point cards, which is disadvantageous if the game is scored based on remaining 
                     cards.
