            Poker is one of the most popular and widely played card games in the world,
            known for its thrilling mix of skill, psychology, and luck.
            Unlike many other games, poker is not just about the cards you are dealtâ€”it's about how you play them.
            Whether you're bluffing, calling, or raising, every move you make influences the game's outcome.
            
            <br>

            Over the years, poker has evolved from a recreational pastime to a professional sport, 
            with millions of dollars at stake in major tournaments like the World Series of Poker (WSOP).
            With numerous variations, including Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud, poker offers endless opportunities for strategic thinking and competitive play.
            Master the rules, sharpen your instincts, and develop your unique playing style to gain an edge at the table."

        <p class="history-text"> 
            "Poker's origins can be traced back to the early 19th century in the United States,
            where it was played in riverboats and saloons along the Mississippi River. 
            Some historians believe its roots go even further, 
            with influences from Persian card games like As-Nas and European games like Poque and Brag.

            <br>

            During the American Civil War, soldiers played poker to pass the time, 
            popularizing it across different states. Over the decades, poker evolved with the introduction of new variants, 
            betting structures, and strategies. The advent of online poker in the late 1990s brought a new wave of players, 
            making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Today, poker is a global phenomenon, featured in high-stakes tournaments, television broadcasts, and online platforms where millions of players compete for glory and financial rewards.

            <br>

            From its humble beginnings as a casual gambling game to its status as a competitive mind sport,
            poker has stood the test of time as one of the most engaging and strategic card games ever created."
