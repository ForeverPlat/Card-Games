                <p class="history-text">
                    Poker's origins can be traced back to the early 19th century in the United States, 
                    where it was played in riverboats and saloons along the Mississippi River. 
                    Some historians believe its roots go even further, 
                    with influences from Persian card games like As-Nas and European games like Poque and Brag.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    During the American Civil War, soldiers played poker to pass the time, popularizing it across different states.
                    Over the decades, poker evolved with the introduction of new variants, betting structures, and strategies. 
                    The advent of online poker in the late 1990s brought a new wave of players, 
                    making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Today, poker is a global phenomenon, 
                    featured in high-stakes tournaments, television broadcasts, 
                    and online platforms where millions of players compete for glory and financial rewards.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    From its humble beginnings as a casual gambling game to its status as a competitive mind sport, 
                    poker has stood the test of time as one of the most engaging and strategic card games ever created.

                    Poker is a game of both skill and luck, 
                    where players compete to win chips by forming the best possible hand or by convincing their opponents to fold. 
                    The game is played with a standard 52-card deck and can accommodate two to ten players at a table. 
                    The most widely played version of poker is Texas Hold'em, but other popular variants include Omaha, 
                    Seven-Card Stud, and Five-Card Draw.

                <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                    Each round of poker consists of several betting phases, where players must decide whether to bet, 
                    call, raise, or fold based on their cards, the community cards (in some variations), 
                    and their ability to read their opponents. 
                    A key aspect of poker is bluffing—convincing others that you have a stronger hand than you actually do. 
                    Mastering when to bluff and when to fold separates average players from the true experts.
                </p>
                <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                    Poker is not just about playing the cards you are dealt—it's about reading the table, 
                    predicting your opponents' moves, and making calculated decisions based on probability and psychology. 
                    Whether you're playing in a home game with friends or facing off in a professional tournament, 
                    understanding the fundamentals of poker gameplay is essential for long-term success.

                <p class="term-text">
                    Bluffing is a strategic move where a player bets or raises with a weak hand to convince opponents they hold a stronger one, 
                    aiming to make them fold. This technique is most effective when opponents are cautious or unsure about their hands, 
                    and it requires careful observation of betting patterns, table dynamics, and player tendencies. 
                    A well-executed bluff can win pots without needing the best hand, but excessive bluffing can make a player predictable and easy to counter.

                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    The flop consists of the first three community cards dealt face-up in poker games like Texas Hold'em and Omaha, 
                    drastically shaping the direction of the hand. 
                    It follows the first round of betting and provides players with additional information to assess their hand's strength, 
                    potential draws, and overall strategy. A strong flop can solidify a winning hand, 
                    while a bad flop can force players to rethink their position or attempt a bluff. 
                    The action continues after the flop with the turn (fourth community card) and river (fifth community card), 
                    both of which can change the outcome of the hand.

                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    Going "all-in" means a player bets all of their remaining chips, committing fully to the current hand and risking elimination if they lose. 
                    This move can be a powerful strategy to pressure opponents, especially in tournaments where chip preservation is key, 
                    or as a desperation move when short-stacked. If multiple players go all-in, a side pot is created for those with additional chips, 
                    while the all-in player can only win the main pot. A well-timed all-in can double or even triple a player's stack, but it also removes their ability to make further betting decisions in the hand.

                    Bad Beat
                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    A bad beat occurs when a player, who was heavily favored to win, loses due to an opponent hitting an extremely unlikely but winning card. For example, 
                    if a player with pocket aces loses to an opponent who catches a straight or flush on the river despite low odds, it's considered a bad beat. 
                    These moments are frustrating because they often defy probability, but they are also what make poker unpredictable and exciting. 
                    Many poker rooms have bad beat jackpots, which award a payout to players who suffer particularly harsh losses, 
                    turning misfortune into an opportunity for consolation winnings.
