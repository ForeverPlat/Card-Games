                    Bridge developed from older trick-taking games, such as the popular 18th- and 19th-century game of whist.
                    One such development was the rise of Biritch, also referred to as Russian Whist, which included early bidding notions
                    that would become a mainstay in later iterations of the game. Early forms of whist served as a foundation for deeper card games.

                    <br>

                    Early in the 20th century, Auction Bridge developed as a result of players' experiments with different bidding techniques. 
                    It added a strategic auction phase to decide the contract for every hand. The game was gradually changed by scoring innovations
                    and rule changes throughout this time, which opened the door for additional improvement. In the 1920s, important players
                    like Harold Vanderbilt helped create Contract Bridge, which established the scoring system and norms that are now the norm in contemporary play.

                    Today, Contract Bridge is praised all over the world as a game that blends strategy, talent, and good partner communication. 
                    It is an active component of the international card-playing community and is played competitively in clubs, tournaments, 
                    and recreational settings.

                Bridge is a strategic card game played by four players in two partnerships. The game has two main phases: 
                the bidding phase and the play phase. In the bidding phase, players determine the contract, which specifies 
                the trump suit (or no trump) and the number of tricks the declaring side must take. Bidding continues until 
                three players pass, and the highest bidder becomes the declarer, with their partner as the dummy.
            </p>
            <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                In the play phase, the declarer tries to fulfill the contract, while the defenders work to stop them. 
                The dummy's hand is placed face-up after the opening lead, and players must follow suit if possible. 
                The highest card of the suit led wins the trick unless a trump card is played, in which case the highest trump wins.
            </p>
            <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                Scoring is based on contract points, bonuses, and penalties. Each trick above six earns points based on the suit, 
                with additional bonuses for slams and honors. If the contract is not met, defenders score points instead.

                            <span class="strategy-meaning"></span> A finesse is a tactical play that increases your chances of winning a trick with a lower honor card. 
                            You lead from one hand and play a lower honor, hoping your opponent does not have the highest card in the suit.
                            Example: If you hold the Queen and Jack of Spades and suspect your left-hand opponent has the King, you can finesse by 
                            leading towards the Queen, hoping the King is played later.
                            Advanced Tip: Be aware of defender signals and previous tricks to estimate the likelihood of success.

                            Example: Using the Stayman convention, a bid of 2♣ after a 1NT opening asks if the partner has a four-card major suit.
                            Advanced Tip: Defensive signals like attitude (high card = encouragement, low card = discouragement) can guide your

                    Trump Suit
                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    In bridge, the trump suit is the most powerful suit in a given hand, determined during the bidding phase. Cards in the trump suit outrank all other suits, 
                    meaning even the lowest-ranked trump card can beat the highest card of any non-trump suit. For example, if spades are declared as trumps, even a 2♠ can win 
                    over an Ace♦. Knowing when to play trumps is crucial for both declarers and defenders. A common strategy is to "draw trumps," meaning the declarer plays trump
                     cards early to remove opponents' trumps, preventing them from using them later to win tricks.

                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    The dummy is the declarer’s partner, whose role is unique compared to other players. After the opening lead, the dummy places their entire hand face-up on the table
                    , allowing everyone to see their cards. However, the dummy does not actively play; instead, the declarer makes decisions for both their own hand and the dummy’s hand. 
                    Since the declarer has full visibility of both hands, they can plan their plays strategically. The dummy’s position provides an advantage but also puts pressure on the declarer to use both hands effectively to fulfill the contract.

                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    The contract is the final bid that dictates the conditions for the hand, including how many tricks the declaring side must win and whether a trump suit or no trump is in play. For example, a contract of 4♥ means the 
                    declarer’s side must win at least 10 tricks (6 base + 4 bid) with hearts as the trump suit. Failing to meet the contract results in penalties for the declarer’s side, while fulfilling or exceeding the contract can earn bonus points. 
                    Skilled players analyze their hand strength carefully before bidding to avoid setting an unrealistic contract that could lead to penalties.

                    Finesse
                </h3>
                <p class="term-text">
                    A finesse is a strategic technique used to increase the chances of winning a trick with a lower honor card by leading strategically. It is based on the assumption that an opponent holds a key higher-ranking card and can be forced to play it 
                    unfavorably. For example, if a player holds Q-J in a suit and suspects that an opponent holds the K, they may lead towards the Q, hoping the K is in the second-hand position and does not get played. A successful finesse allows the player to win a trick
                     without needing the highest card in that suit. However, finessing is not guaranteed and requires careful observation of previous plays to assess whether the strategy is likely to succeed.
