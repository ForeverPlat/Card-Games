Perceivable
-Several images were missing meaningful alt text or used vague descriptions like "cards". We had to to change it and make the alt tags more descriptive.

-Important image context (e.g., famous players) was  provided for most of them using <figure> and <figcaption>. However the captions were vague and not Descriptive enough and were missing some.



Operable
-

Understandable
-Use consistent navigation and headings across all pages. We had a different nav bar for each page and had no uniform main menu/nav bar

Robust
-Use semantic tags: <main>, <article>, <header>, <nav>, <footer> . We realized that for main we used it incorrectly at first so we changed it and used it appropriately for the main content.
