Perceivable
-Several images were missing meaningful alt text or used vague descriptions like "cards". We had to to change it and make the alt tags more descriptive.

-Important image context (e.g., famous players) was  provided for most of them using <figure> and <figcaption>. However the captions were vague and not Descriptive enough and were missing some.

-Consistent heading structure (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) was used to create a logical flow of content.



Operable

-The navigation bar uses clear, consistent links and is placed at the top of the page for easy access.

Understandable

-Use consistent navigation and headings across all pages. We had a different nav bar for each page and had no uniform main menu/nav bar.

- The <meta name="description"> was rewritten to better explain the pageâ€™s content in search results and screen readers.

Robust
-Use semantic tags: <main>, <article>, <header>, <nav>, <footer> . We realized that for main we used it incorrectly at first so we changed it and used it appropriately for the main content.

-Proper nesting and structure of elements were maintained to avoid rendering issues.

-The use of semantic HTML (<main>, <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <section>, <article>) enhances cross-platform support.
