                    The card game "Sevens," also known as "Laying Out Sevens," "Fan Tan," or "Parliament," has a rich history with roots in various cultures. Its exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but the game's fundamental mechanics have been present in numerous regional variations 
                    over the centuries. The primary objective across these versions involves players shedding their cards by sequentially playing them in a specific order, typically starting with the seven of each suit. This gameplay resembles that of dominoes,
                     where players lay down cards in a connected sequence, reflecting the game's adaptability and widespread appeal.

                    <br><br>

                    In different countries, "Sevens" has adopted unique names and rules, showcasing its versatility. In the United States, the game is often referred to as "Fan Tan" or "Play or Pay," where players aim to be the first to discard all their cards by building upon the sevens 
                    laid out on the table. In France, a similar game called "Domino" allows players to start sequences with any rank, adding a layer of strategic variation. These regional adaptations highlight the game's ability to transcend cultural boundaries while maintaining its core mechanics.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    The enduring popularity of "Sevens" can be attributed to its simple yet strategic gameplay, making it accessible to players of all ages. Its presence in various cultures under different names underscores its universal appeal and adaptability. Whether played in a casual family setting or as a competitive pastime, "Sevens" continues to be a beloved card game that brings people together through its engaging and timeless mechanics.

                        Sevens, also known as "Parliament" or "Fan Tan," is a simple and fun card game for 3 to 7 players. 
                        The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, and the goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. 
                        Players take turns building sequences in suit, starting with the 7s placed in the center. 
                        From there, cards must be played in ascending or descending order within the same suit (e.g., 6♣, 5♣ or 8♣, 9♣, etc.). 
                        If a player can’t play, they pass their turn. The game encourages strategic thinking as players block or enable others while carefully planning their own moves.
