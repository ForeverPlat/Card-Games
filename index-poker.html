                    Poker's origins can be traced back to the early 19th century in the United States, 
                    where it was played in riverboats and saloons along the Mississippi River. 
                    Some historians believe its roots go even further, 
                    with influences from Persian card games like As-Nas and European games like Poque and Brag.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    During the American Civil War, soldiers played poker to pass the time, popularizing it across different states.
                    Over the decades, poker evolved with the introduction of new variants, betting structures, and strategies. 
                    The advent of online poker in the late 1990s brought a new wave of players, 
                    making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Today, poker is a global phenomenon, 
                    featured in high-stakes tournaments, television broadcasts, 
                    and online platforms where millions of players compete for glory and financial rewards.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    From its humble beginnings as a casual gambling game to its status as a competitive mind sport, 
                    poker has stood the test of time as one of the most engaging and strategic card games ever created.

                    Poker is a game of both skill and luck, 
                    where players compete to win chips by forming the best possible hand or by convincing their opponents to fold. 
                    The game is played with a standard 52-card deck and can accommodate two to ten players at a table. 
                    The most widely played version of poker is Texas Hold'em, but other popular variants include Omaha, 
                    Seven-Card Stud, and Five-Card Draw.
                </p>
                <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                    Each round of poker consists of several betting phases, where players must decide whether to bet, 
                    call, raise, or fold based on their cards, the community cards (in some variations), 
                    and their ability to read their opponents. 
                    A key aspect of poker is bluffing—convincing others that you have a stronger hand than you actually do. 
                    Mastering when to bluff and when to fold separates average players from the true experts.
                </p>
                <p class="gameplay-info-text">
                    Poker is not just about playing the cards you are dealt—it's about reading the table, 
                    predicting your opponents' moves, and making calculated decisions based on probability and psychology. 
                    Whether you're playing in a home game with friends or facing off in a professional tournament, 
                    understanding the fundamentals of poker gameplay is essential for long-term success.
